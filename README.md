## What is CHIP-8?

CHIP-8 is a vintage programming language and virtual machine designed for early computer game development in the 1970s. Its architecture revolves around a simple set of 16 general-purpose registers, memory for program storage and execution, and a monochrome 64x32 pixel display. Programs are interpreted by a CHIP-8 virtual machine, utilizing basic instructions for arithmetic, bitwise operations, memory handling, and control flow. The language features a stack mechanism for managing subroutines, two timers for delay and sound effects, and input from a 16-key hexadecimal keypad. Notably, CHIP-8 programs are typically stored starting at memory address 0x200, and graphics are drawn using sprites of 8x15 pixels. Despite its rudimentary nature, CHIP-8 remains influential, serving as an accessible platform for learning and emulator development due to its straightforward architecture and concise instruction set.

## Why Did We Create This?

I made this CHIP-8 emulator to learn more and make a better version of CHIP-8 emulation. The goal was to improve my skills and provide users with a more advanced and capable emulation of CHIP-8. The project is a way for me to grow and offer a better experience for anyone interested in CHIP-8 emulation.
